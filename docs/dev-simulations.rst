======================================
Run debug simulations in Visual Studio
======================================

If you have modified the |EMOD_s| source code, you can run simulations directly from Visual Studio
as part of debugging your changes by using the built-in debugger. For example, you may want to run
one or more of the simulations in the Regression_ directory to verify that the results match those
obtained prior to your changes.

#.  Open the EradicationKernel solution in Visual Studio.
#.  On the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click the **Eradication** project and select **Properties**.
#.  On the **Property Pages** window, in the **Configuration Properties** pane, click **Debugging**.
#.  Set the **Command Arguments** and **Working Directory** to the appropriate values and click **OK**.
    See :doc:`software-simulation-cli` for more information.
#.  On the **Debug** menu, do one of the following:

    *   Click **Start Without Debugging** to run the simulation in Release
        mode, where the simulation runs with essentially the same behavior and performance as
        running it at the command line.

    *   Click **Start Debugging** to run the simulation in Debug mode, where you have
        the ability to add break points and step through the code, inspecting the values of different
        variables throughout the simulation.
