Create a new regression test
===================================

You can create a new regression based off one of the ones included with the |EMOD_s| source code
using the steps below.

#.  Under the Regression_ directory, create a new subdirectory.
#.  Copy the contents of the regression test that you want to base the new test on into the subdirectory.
#.  Modify the configuration, campaign, and demographic files as desired.
#.  Create the reference output by doing one of the following:

    *   Modify the InsetChart.json file to match the output you expect.
    *   Run simulations until you have an acceptable InsetChart.json that you wish to use as
        the reference.
