=============

This section provides information for researchers and developers who want to modify the EMOD-Generic source code to add more functionality to the model. For example, by adding custom reports or creating a new simulation type for modeling a disease that EMOD doesnâ€™t currently support. The docs describe how to build the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) from source code, run tests, debug errors, and more.
