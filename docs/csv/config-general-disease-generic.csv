"Enable_Strain_Tracking","boolean","0","1","0","Enable an association of an infection with a specified strain, defined by unique integers for a clade and a genome. 

For infections distributed through interventions, you specify clade and genome values using the **Clade** and **Genome** parameters with the :doc:`parameter-campaign-node-outbreak` and :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-outbreakindividual` intervention classes in the campaign file.

When using an initial prevalence distribution, you specify clade and genome values using the **InitialPrevalenceStrains** parameter as part of :ref:`demo-individualattributes` in the demographics file.

When **Enable_Strain_Tracking** is set to false (0) or absent, all infections are associated with a single strain that has clade and genome identity (0, 0).

When **Enable_Strain_Tracking** is set to true (1) then both **Number_of_Clades** and **Log2_Number_of_Genomes_per_Clade** parameters must be specified.

.. warning::

    Do not set both **Enable_Strain_Tracking** and  **Enable_Infectivity_Reservoir** to true (1) or **Enable_Strain_Tracking** and  **Enable_Maternal_Infection_Transmission** to true (1) - as these combinations will cause an exception error.",".. code-block:: json
