Age_Bin
   Assign individuals to age bins. Use with **Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years**. Cannot be used with **NodeProperties**.
Accessibility
   Tag individuals or nodes based on their accessibility. 
Geographic
   Tag individuals or nodes based on geographic characteristics.
HasActiveTB
   Tag individuals or nodes based on active TB status. Typically used only with HIV ART staging interventions.
InterventionStatus
   Tag individuals or nodes based on intervention status, so that receiving an intervention can affect how other interventions are distributed. Use with **Disqualifying_Properties** and **New_Property_Value** in the campaign file. 
Place
   Tag individuals or nodes based on place.
Risk
   Tag individuals or nodes based on disease risk.
QualityofCare
   Tag individuals or nodes based on the quality of medical care.
