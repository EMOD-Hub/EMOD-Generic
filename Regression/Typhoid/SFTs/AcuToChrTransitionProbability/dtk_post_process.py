# This SFT test the following statements:
# All Acute infections go to Chronic or Susceptible state.
# The proportion of individuals who move to chronic infections is determined by the config parameter Config:CPG multiply by hardcoded Gallstones table. The remainder shall move to Susceptible.
# This test passes when the number of went to Chronic cases is within binomial 95% confidence interval
# for each test, there is 5% of chance that we will reject the hypothesis while it's true
