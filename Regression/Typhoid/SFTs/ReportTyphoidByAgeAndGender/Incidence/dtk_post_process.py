# This SFT test the following statements:
# 1. Time of Report (Year): Reporting is accumulated on a yearly basis. This value represents the reporting time
# and the year that stats are accumulated over.
#    Example: A value of 1969.997 indicates that reporting is for the year 1969.
# 3. Pre-Patent (Inc), Chronic (Inc), Sub-Clinical (inc) and Acute (inc) represent new cases occurring
# over the year time period.
# note: Incidence. We calculate this all year for a given year of recording.
#       The age used is the snapshot age at the time of the infection event.
#       As a result, we could record a prepat event for someone age X and then if they had
#       their birthday before becoming acute, they would roll up in the next age bin for the acute incidence.
