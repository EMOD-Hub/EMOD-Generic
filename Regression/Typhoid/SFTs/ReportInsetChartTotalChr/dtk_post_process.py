# This SFT test the following statement:
# At each time step, the # of total Chronic infections in "Number of Chronic Carriers" channel in InsetChart.json
# equals the new Chronic infections in log plus the total # of Chronic case from previous time step
# the duration of Chronic state is life long, so the total Chronic infection will not decrease
# (note:"Enable_Vital_Dynamics": 0 )
