# This SFT test the following statements:
# probability of infection from route contact is driven by this formula:
# P(infection) = 1- (1- immunity * P(response))#exposures
# It's a beta-binomial distribution
# the actual number of infection from route contact is within the 95% confidence interval of binomial distribution
