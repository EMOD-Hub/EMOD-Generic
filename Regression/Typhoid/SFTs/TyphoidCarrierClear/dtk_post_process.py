"""
This is a test for TyphoidCarrierClear intervention. 
We verify that the day after intervention is administered, all of the people who were chronic 
before are no longer chronic and only those people. Verifies that sick people who are not chronic are still sick.
Ignores people who go chronic on the day of campaign as those people are not cleared. 
This is not a statistical test.
This is not testing Clearance_Rate as it's not used.
This is not reading data out of campaign.json.

Intervention spec:
This individual-targeted intervention immediately clears an infected individual’s Typhoid infection (and expires). 
Note that despite its name it will clear Typhoid infections of all types. 
And it takes a Clearance_Rate parameter but that is for “future expansion” and is not currently used.

Sweep suggestion:
Run_Number, Population size
