# This SFT test the following statement:
# Seasonality. The amount of environmental contagion (dose) to which an individual is exposed is attenuated/amplified
#  by a seasonality factor
#              that varies throughout the year according to a trapezoidal pattern.
#              The ramp durantions and cutoff days need to follow a rule where: ramp_up_duration + ramp_down_duration
#                + cutoff_days < 365
#              check environmental amplification and exposure for each individual, in each time step
