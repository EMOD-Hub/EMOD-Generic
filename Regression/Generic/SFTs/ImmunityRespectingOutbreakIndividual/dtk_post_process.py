"""
The OutbreakIndividual intervention is used to seed infected individuals in a population
without changing population via having individuals in the population acquire new infections
at random. The behavior of OutbreakIndividual is such that it does not check a chosen
individual's immune state before infecting them. ImmunityRespectingOutbreakIndividual was
developed to enable a behavior mode in which individual immune state is considered.

Specifically, individuals are chosen at random for potential infection according to the
Demographic_Coverage of the event. Once an individual is chosen, their probability of acquiring
a new infection is equal to the produce of their acquisition immune modifier and any acquisition-reducing
intervention effects - (susceptibility->getModAcquire()*interventions->GetInterventionReducedAcquire()).
In this way, selected individuals who are fully susceptible will definitely acquire an outbreak,
individuals who are fully protected will definitely not, and those in between may or may not acquire infection.

This behavior is useful for testing acquisition-reducing features, by providing a direct
means of challenging individuals with infection. It is useful in simulations in which it is
important that immune individuals do not become reinfected, ever. It is also useful in simulations
in which immune individuals are heavily downsampled, as the remaining immune individuals, who may
represent tens or hundreds of people, may have an outsized effect on disease progression if they
become randomly infected through a standard OutbreakIndividual.
