"""
SimpleBoosterVaccine is derived from SimpleVaccine, and preserves many of the same parameters.
The behavior is much like SimpleVaccine, except that upon distribution and successful take,
the vaccine's effect is determined by the recipient's immune state. If the recipient's immunity
modifier in the corresponding channel (Acquisition, Transmission, Mortality) is above a user-specified
threshold (Boost_Threshold), then the vaccine's initial effect will be equal to the parameter
Prime_Effect. If the recipient's immune modifier is below this threshold, then the vaccine's
initial effect will be equal to the parameter Boost_Effect. After distribution, the effect evolves
according to the Waning_Config, just like a Simple Vaccine. In essence, this intervention provides
a SimpleVaccine with one effect to all naive (below- threshold) individuals, and another effect to
all primed (above-threshold) individuals; this behavior is intended to mimic, to some degree,
biological priming and boosting.

All parameters necessary to define a SimpleVaccine are also necessary for a SimpleBoosterVaccine
(though the Initial_Effect of the Waning_Config will be overwritten by one of Prime_Effect or
Boost_Effect upon distribution).
