0. Config enables event db, sets 5 day incubation period, 5 day infectious period
1. Campaign gives OutbreakIndividual with Incubation period enabled day 2
2. dtk_in_process starts day 5 giving 1.0 Transmission blocking vaccines
Expected:
1. Number of New Infections after the Outbreak is exactly equal to campaign cost
2. After 10 days of simulation, zero new infections (Each person who could have been infectious got vaccinateD)

0. Config enables event db
1. Start with an outbreak day 5
2. After day 10, start finding people with New Infections, and add a txn blocking vax for each one
3. At end of simulation:
3.1 VERIFY campaign cost == infections
3.2 MAYBE VERIFY rate of new infections declines dramatically
"""

"""
Enhanced: Only give as many as 20 vax a day.
If more than 20, rest get written into a "vax queue" file
So at each timestep, see if "vax queue" file exists and fill from there first
Maybe have a log file about "What we know and what we've tried to do?"

What could go wrong with Explicit ID?
- Migration: ID may change if in different node
- Birth / Death: How would I test targeting a dead person
- Invalid ID: What does model do if ID doesn't exist?

What features do I want:
- Interrogate population: Is person still around?
