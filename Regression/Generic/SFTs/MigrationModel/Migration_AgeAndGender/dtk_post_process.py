This test operates thusly:
1. The immigration rates are defined in the 3x3_Age_Gender_Local.json
    A. Node layout  N
                  1 2 3
                W 4 5 6 E
                  7 8 9
                    S
    B. Age Structure: All agents are in one of three age buckets
      i.   20 - 20.1 years (young)
      ii.  40 - 40.1 years
      iii. 60 - 60.1 years (old)
    C. Migration rate calculation. Add the following:
      i.   Base migration probability to any neighbor node is 0.04
      ii.  Young people add 0.02 to Western migration, -0.01 to Eastern
           Old people add 0.02 to Eastern migration, -0.01 to Western
      iii. Males add 0.03 to Northern migration, -0.01 to Southern
           Females add 0.03 to Southern migration, -0.01 to Northern
2. The other immigration files (*.bin, *.bin.json) were generated with
 the files in /Scripts/MigrationTools
3. Enable ReportNodeDemographics in custom_reports.json
4. Run sim for 400 days
5. After which
    A. Northern nodes should have more men
    B. Southern nodes should have more women
    C. Eastern nodes should have more old people
    D. Western nodes should have more young people
6. The migration binaries ONLY exist in this folder, validating DtkTrunk issue 2166
