SFTs for migration model, this includes test for follows

Migration Mode: LOCAL | REGIONAL | AIR | SEA 

[Migration Mode]_Migration_Filename
[Migration Mode]_Migration_Roundtrip_Duration
[Migration Mode]_Migration_Roundtrip_Probability

Migration_Model: NO_MIGRATION | FIXED_RATE_MIGRATION

Migration_Pattern: RANDOM_WALK_DIFFUSION | SINGLE_ROUND_TRIPS | WAYPOINTS_HOME

Please refer to https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/Documentation/general/parameter-configuration.html#migration for detailed explanation of relevant parameters. 
 
The test methodology is trying to match time to next migration for each agent with a hypothetical exponential distribution with a mean of 1/lambda, where lambda is the individual migration rate given in the migration bin file (see https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/Documentation/general/file-migration.html).

RANDOM_WALK:
- transform df_human_migration to [Time From_Node To_Node, MigrationType] as df_migration_type
	for each Migration type m
		for each time step t
			compare [ count of [df_migration_type] from each Node [i,j] pair (migration from node i->j at time t) / sum of [df_node_demog].NumIndividual(node i population at time t) ] ~= rate of migration for [Node i,j]
- validate each individual's migration internval in df_human_migration match exponential distribution of lambda = migration rate, by:

FOR WAYPOINTS_HOME model:
Check that all agent's travelling pattern should be in the pattern of A->X1->X2->...->Xk-> ..X2->X1->A,, where k is config.Roundtrip_Waypoints;

For SINGLE_ROUND_TRIPS model:
it's just a special case of WAYPOINTS_HOME but with config.Roundtrip_Waypoints = 1 (except that there's no duration limit/return probably as set by *_Roundtrip_Duration/*_Roundtrip_Probability), so we could reuse the above simulation and set config.Roundtrip_Waypoints = 1 accordingly;


if the SFT passed, the output file (normally scientific_feature_report.txt) will show params for run as well as "Success=True", as follows:
	Simulation parameters: simulation_duration=100, migration_pattern=RANDOM_WALK_DIFFUSION, migration_model=FIXED_RATE_MIGRATION, demog_filenames=[u'1x2_demographics_migration_heterogeneity.json']
	:
    SUMMARY: Success=True

if the SFT failed, the output file (normally scientific_feature_report.txt) will show params for run, "Success=False", as well as which test(s) failed, as follows:
	Simulation parameters: simulation_duration=100, migration_pattern=RANDOM_WALK_DIFFUSION, migration_model=FIXED_RATE_MIGRATION, demog_filenames=[u'1x2_demographics_migration_heterogeneity.json']
