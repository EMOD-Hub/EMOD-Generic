This SFT is testing environmental feature 2.4 Seasonality:

"Seasonal attenuation. You can specify a trapezoidal-shaped infectivity multiplier on the environmental contagion. 
Seasonality and dose for environmental transmission: Exposure to the environmental reservoir varies seasonally, 
and is mediated by the parameter seasonality_factor (where fExposure = fEnvironment * seasonality_factor. Note that 
seasonality_factor represents the current value of the seasonality infectivity multiplier under Seasonal Forcing). 
The seasonality can start or end at any time during the year, with a periodicity of 365 days. The pattern is anchored 
at the value Environmental_Peak_Start, which indicates the day of year peak seasonality starts. At the highest point 
in the season, individuals are exposed to 100% of the environmental reservoir (seasonality_factor = 1). At low season, 
there is no dose through the environment and transmission is dependent on contact transmission (seasonality_factor = 0).

Seasonality follows a trapezoidal shape with the following parameters:

    Environmental_Peak_Start (t0 on Fig. 1)
    Environmental_Ramp_Down_Duration (t1 to t2 on Fig. 1)
    Environmental_Cutoff_Days (t2 to t3 on Fig. 1)
    Environmental_Ramp_Up_Duration (t3 to t4 on Fig. 1)
Note that the sum total of all durations will be < 365.

Specific days of the year act as transition points:

    Seasonal_factor max. Seasonal_factor remains at 1 (from t0 to t1 on Fig. 1)
    
        Seasonal_factor remains at 1 for the number of days determined by: 
        #Days = 365 – Environmental_Ramp_Down_Duration - Environmental_Cutoff_Days – Environmental_Ramp_Up_Duration
    
    Seasonal_factor decrease. Seasonal_factor linearly decreases with each day from 1 to 0 (from t1 to t2 on Fig. 1).
    
        A linear decrease occurs between seasonal_factor 1 and 0 with slope determined by Environmental_Ramp_Down_Duration.
    
    Seasonal_factor min. Seasonal_factor remains at 0 (from t2 to t3 on Fig. 1).
    
        Seasonal_factor remains at 0 for the duration of Environmental_Cutoff_Days.
    
    Seasonal_factor increase. Seasonal_factor linearly increases with each day from 0 - 1 (from t3 to t4 on Fig. 1).

        A linear increase occurs between seasonal_factor 0 and 1 with slope determined by Environmental_Ramp_Up_Duration.
