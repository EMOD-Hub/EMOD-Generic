"""
Basic calculations
Each node contains a total amount of infectivity that is equal to the sum of the infectivities of each individual 
present in that node. An individual's infectivity is the product of that individual's infectiousness and sampling 
weight. An individual's infectiousness is based on the disease dynamics as described in that section: infectivity = 
SUM(individual_infectiousness * individual_sample_weight)

The probability of an individual in a node receiving an infection (absent structured transmission HINT as described in 
that section) is determined by an infection rate that is equal to the total infectivity in that node divided by the 
total population in that node: infection_rate = infectivity / stat_pop

An individual gets a new infection during a timestep dt with probability 1-exp(-infection_rate*dt). That probability 
is decreased by immunity: actual_probability =  1 - exp(- infection_rate * dt * mod_acquire)

NOTE: AN INDIVIDUAL'S PROBABILITY OF INFECTION IS INDEPENDENT OF THAT INDIVIDUAL'S SAMPLING WEIGHT

The number of unweighted (individual_sample_weight = 1) immunologically na√Øve (mod_acquire = 1) individuals infected 
during a timestep should be distributed as a binomial draw with probability 1-exp(-infection_rate*dt).

The expression for probability of infection derives from the Poisson distribution. The Poisson rate parameter for number 
of infections occurring in a node during a timestep dt is infectivity*dt, with exp(-infection_rate*dt) equal to the 
probability of a single individual receiving zero infections, and 1-exp(-infection rate*dt) equal to the probability of 
a single individual receiving one or more infections.

This infection process is exactly equivalent to randomly selecting (with replacement) a number of indivduals to receive 
infections, where the number of individuals selected during a timestep is distributed as a Poisson draw with rate 
parameter equal to infectivity*dt.
