# DTK regression/commission support package specifically pre- and post-processing scripts.

These scripts are created and supported by the IDM Dev team as part of the Regression Testing work and are intended to be useful for research. This module should NOT house generally useful utility scripts for the DTK team, which belong to DtkUtils. 

It would be good if these weren't closely tied to DTK versions.

To install:

```
python -m pip install dtk_ep4 --index-url https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/idm-pypi-production/simple --upgrade
```
